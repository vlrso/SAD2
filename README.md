# SAD2
This is a repository for a test project in our Software Engineering course, or SAD2 for short. 

How to reproduce this project:
Install VSCode
Install NodeJS
On VSCode Terminal, select the default profile to 'cmd' (npm does not work in powershell, this was the only solution i know that works)
