# SAD2
This is a repository for a test project in our Software Engineering course, or SAD2 for short. 

How to reproduce this project:

Install VSCode

Install NodeJS

On VSCode Terminal, select the default profile to 'cmd' (npm does not work in powershell, this was the only solution i know that works)

npm create vite@latest

type the project name you prefer to call the project

for framework, choose react using arrow keys(up and down), then enter to choose

for variant, choose javascript

there should be instructions displayed in the console after the setup, just type them on the console one line at a time

Note: to close the project just close vscode. to re-open the project you must open the project folder and change the console directory to that project folder, then type npm run dev (safe mode for developing, "npm start" is for the website is ready for publishing)
